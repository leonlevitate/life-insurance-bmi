## Approach

I created this project in approximately 7 hours, over the course of 2 days, which included some time learning and practicing React fundamentals.

To separate the building blocks for the user interface, I produced three main components: **Range** (calcualates the BMI range), **Output** (displays output content), and **Smoker**.

I also installed a calendar _DatePicker_ npm package, and wrapped it in a component to capture the date of birth.

For the CSS, I formed my own design, but also included a template from www.cssportal.com for the height and weight range bars.

## Reflection

As I'm relatively new to learning React, unfortunately I did not manage to fully implement all of the requirements. The majority of my time was focused on building a robust BMI calculator, and I succeeded with this. My aim was to develop a coefficient matrix to generate a quote based on other conditional logic. I would have also designed some more tests using Jest. With more time and practice, I feel confident that I would be able to build the application to meet the complete user spec.

I enjoy working with React, and plan on continuing my learning by building projects with React Router, Redux, GraphQL/Relay, and Jest.
