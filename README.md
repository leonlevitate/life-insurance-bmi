# BMI Calculator

## Installation

Clone the repository and then run the following commands:

#### `npm install`

#### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>

## Approach

To separate the building blocks for the user interface, I produced three main components: **Range** (calculates the BMI range), **Output** (displays output content), and **Smoker**.

I also installed a calendar _DatePicker_ npm package, and wrapped it in a component to capture the date of birth.

For the CSS, I formed my own design, but also included a template from www.cssportal.com for the height and weight range bars.
